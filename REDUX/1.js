/*Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of different web technologies, including React.

In Redux, there is a single state object that's responsible for the entire state of your application. This means if you had a React app with ten components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of your app would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux store (the Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state)*/

/* The reducer function takes state as an argument and returns state*/
const reducer = (state = 5) => {
    return state;
  }
  
  // Redux methods are available from a Redux object
  // For example: Redux.createStore()
  // Define the store here:
  const store = Redux.createStore(reducer)
