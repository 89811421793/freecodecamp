/*Updating state is one of Redux's core tasks. In Redux, all state updates are triggered by dispatching actions. An action is simply a JavaScript object that contains information about an action event that has occurred. The Redux store receives these action objects, then updates its state accordingly. */

// Define an action here:
const action = {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
