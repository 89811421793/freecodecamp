  <!-- The region role is used to identify document areas that are deemed significant; every region role 
    requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region.  -->
  
  <!-- One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference
    it with the aria-labelledby attribute. -->
